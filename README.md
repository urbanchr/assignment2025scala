# 5CCS2PEP - Scala coursework

Welcome back!  This is your GitHub repository for working on the *second* half of 5CCS2PEP, in which Christian will be teaching Scala.  The work in this repository is worth 50% of your marks on the module.

# How can I get help?

In addition to the video lecture content, and the large-group tutorial, you have timetabled small-group tutorials.  The TAs on this module are excellent, so make sure you use this time well -- look at the coursework before the tutorial, so you already have questions to ask the TAs when you arrive.  

In addition to this, we have a KEATS discussion forum where you can ask further questions about the languages you are learning, or to clarify the coursework questions.  This is the best place to ask questions, as if we give additional help or advice, all the students in the class can benefit.  Though don't post partial/complete answers here, or you might run into issues with other students plagiarising your code.

The module lecturers have weekly office hours, which you are encouraged to use.  You can get detailed, individual feedback on your work this way; and it also helps us know what students have found challenging, so we can recap materials in the lectures.

Finally, there's email.  It's there, but it's often not the best solution.  Basic queries should go to the KEATS forum so the whole class can benefit from the answer; we may decline to answer such questions via email, in the interests of fairness, so post to KEATS to start with.  

# Workflow for this module

## How do I use this GitHub repository?

In each directory, you'll find questions to work on.  Take a `clone` of this repository from GitHub; then to submit work, `commit` and `push` to send your work back to GitHub.  You can (and should) commit and push your work as many times as you'd like. But be mindful to the testing server and other students, so "as many times as you'd like" should normally mean at most once every our.

At the deadline:

- A `clone` of your repository will be taken, and the appropriate work marked.  This is your *on time* mark.
- 24 hours later, another `clone` of your repository will be taken, and the appropriate work marked again.  This is your *late* mark, and will be capped at 40%.

The mark you will be awarded is then the *best* of either your on time mark, or your capped late mark.  The word best here is important -- if you push some work after the deadline, don't worry, your on-time work was cloned at the deadline, and will be marked uncapped.

Make sure you don't commit any compiled code to your GitHub repository; or if you choose to use an IDE, any large project directories created by your IDE.  You can make these on your machine, but don't `commit` or `add` them to your repository -- this isn't what git is designed for.  Source code for extra code you've written is fine, `make' files, text files, etc. -- good.  Compiled code or auto-generated project directories -- bad.

## How we mark your code

Each question gives you a specification for some code, and some basic test cases.  To mark your work, we will run your code with a different, larger range of test cases; each of these has a mark attached that is used to then give the mark to your work.  Your feedback for the work will be an test report detailing each of the test cases used, whether the test passed or failed, and/or other diagnostic information.  

With reference to the module title -- we mark work using test cases, because writing code that fulfils a given specification, and passes some given test cases, is an important practical experience of programming.  Also important is writing test cases -- you're encouraged to write your own to be additionally confident in your code, as whilst the test cases we have given you are helpful, they're not exhaustive.

We won't be marking whether your code has comments or is correctly indented, but you are encouraged to keep good habits.  As noted above ('How do I use this GitHub repository?') don't add compiled code or large project directories to your GitHub repository; your mark for a given assignment may be multiplied by 0.9 where such files are added and are excessive in size.  The following are examples of what *may* be added to your repository:

- The source code for additional test cases you've written yourself
- A text file containing a to-do list, or other working notes
- A `.gitignore` file or `.gitattributes` file

The following are examples of what may *not* be added:

- Compiled code -- `.class` files (for the Warmup exercises), compiled executable files, `.o` or `.obj` files, debugging symbols (e.g. `.ipch` files)
- `.idea` directories
- `foo.dSYM` directories, as created by XCode for the executable `foo`
- `.DS_Store` files
- `CMakeCache.txt`, `CMakeFiles`, etc. as created when CMake compiles a project
- `.vs` directories, as made by VSCode
- `.bsp` scala build server files

If you're not sure what you can add, ask in the KEATS forum.


# Schedule of Scala coursework

The work here is organised into three core parts and four main parts (2 - 5), aligned with the language features taught in each of the five Scala lectures. Some of the early questions might be challenging, even if they use conceptually simple features, so don't feel obliged to complete all of the core parts before moving on to main parts -- do what you can.  Either way, even though it is due in January, you're heavily advised to do some of it each week and not leave it all 'til the deadline.

# Lessons learnt from previous years

We've taught this module for a number of years now.  Here are hints for you based on the experiences of students in previous years:

## 0) Don't cheat

In this module, everything should be your own work -- no plagiarism (e.g. copy-pasting from websites), no collusion (e.g. working with or sharing code with another student).  By pushing work to GitHub, you are submitting work for assessment, and making a statement that the submission is your own work.

We have effective tools in place for detecting plagiarism and collusion, so if you're thinking of copying code, don't think you can get away with it by e.g. renaming a few variables.  Any plagiarism or collusion we find will be dealt with under the College procedures.

## 1) Don't try to pattern-match the test cases rather than solving the problem

Many of the questions ask you to implement functions, with test cases that check they give the right outputs for the right inputs.  Don't try to game the system by making your code just do e.g:

`if (...inputs are for the first testcase...)`
 `{ solution to the first testcase }`  
`else if (...inputs are for the second testcase...) {`  
 `{ solution to the second testcase }`  
`else if... `  

Your code will be marked against different testcases, so this won't work.

## 2) Actually use git

GitHub has a built in text editor, which allows you to edit files in your GitHub repository without following the clone, commit, push workflow I mention above.  *This is a really bad idea.*  Use git, and get used to using git.  That way you can compile and run your code on your machine and test that it compiles before pushing it to be marked.

As a cheat-sheat for git at the command line:

- `git clone <url>`  will clone (i.e. copy to your machine) the given GitHub repository
- `git commit -a` will commit all the files you've modified since you last made a commit, i.e. save a copy of your work to the version history on your machine
- `git push` will push this work back to GitHub.

There are GUI tools and other interfaces for GitHub, but at least in this module, you won't be using the fancier features of git that support teamwork, so the above three commands will do most of what you need.

## 3) Don't forget to push

`git commit -a` stores all modified files in the git version history (repository) on your machine.  `git push` sends anything you've committed to GitHub.  If you don't push, you haven't submitted your work, and I can't mark it.

## 4) Commit and push regularly

Every time you've done a small part of an assignment and you're happy with it, commit and push.  That way, GitHub has taken a backup of your work.  If you then screw up your code, you can go back to the version in GitHub.  If you drop your laptop in the Thames, you at least have a version on GitHub, to clone onto another machine and keep working on.  One day, you'll have a major data loss, and wish you'd taken backups.

## 5) Don't change your GitHub username part way through term

We need to know which GitHub is yours so you get the marks.  If you change your GitHub username we don't know which is your work, so you get a zero.  I don't mind if you have another GitHub username that you use for other purposes, but keep the same one for PEP.

## 6) The coursework covers the full range of marks

On each module you take at King's, the marks awarded to the class will cover the full range.  This ensures academic standards are maintained, and hence the value of your degree.  If a module is 100% exam, the exam will contain questions of varying difficulty, including some challenging questions that only the most able students can answer (or can answer well).  This module is 100% coursework, so the same applies here -- the coursework has challenging questions, and the overall marks cover the full range.

I mention this as this may be different to your expectations from other modules.  For instance, for modules that are 15% coursework and 85% exam, sometimes the coursework is relatively easier than the exam; e.g. a student might get 90% in the coursework and 65% in the exam.  This is okay -- it just means the exam has the challenging questions needed to ensure the overall marks cover the full range.  But remember, in PEP, we don't have an exam: all the challenge for the module is in the coursework.  Hence, your coursework marks might be lower than you'd expect from a 15%-coursework-modules, but it doesn't mean you're doing badly (or that we're being unfair).
